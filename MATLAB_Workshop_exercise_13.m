%% Exercise 1:
% Create a mechanical model of an (undamped) mass sitting inside two 
% springs (see Fig. 1) without gravitational forces. The springs should 
% have the same spring constant k1 = k2 = 1 N/m and the mass should be 2 
% kg. To do this, follow these steps:
% a) Think about the physics involved. What are the forces? How do they 
% connect with displacement and velocity?



% b) Create your model in Simulink according to the physical equations.



% c) Put scopes for displacement and velocity.



% d) Run the model with a pulse of amplitude 1 and watch it moving freely.



% e) Explore how changing mass and spring constants change the dynamics of 
% the system. Also explore the phase relationship between displacement and 
% velocity.



%% Exercise 2 (optional):
% Extend your mass-spring model by adding friction. How do displacement and 
% velocity change?
